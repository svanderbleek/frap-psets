(* Here's a classic recursive, functional program for factorial. *)
Fixpoint fact (n : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | O => 1
  | S n' => fact n' * S n'
  end.

(* But let's reformulate factorial relationally, as an example to explore
 * treatment of inductive relations in Coq.  First, these are the states of our
 * state machine. *)
Inductive fact_state :=
| AnswerIs (answer : nat)
| WithAccumulator (input accumulator : nat).

(* *Initial* states *)
Inductive fact_init (original_input : nat) : fact_state -> Prop :=
| FactInit : fact_init original_input (WithAccumulator original_input 1).

(** *Final* states *)
Inductive fact_final : fact_state -> Prop :=
| FactFinal : forall ans, fact_final (AnswerIs ans).

(** The most important part: the relation to step between states *)
Inductive fact_step : fact_state -> fact_state -> Prop :=
| FactDone : forall acc,
  fact_step (WithAccumulator O acc) (AnswerIs acc)
| FactStep : forall n acc,
  fact_step (WithAccumulator (S n) acc) (WithAccumulator n (acc * S n)).

(* We care about more than just single steps.  We want to run factorial to
 * completion, for which it is handy to define a general relation of
 * *transitive-reflexive closure*, like so. *)
Inductive trc {A} (R : A -> A -> Prop) : A -> A -> Prop :=
| TrcRefl : forall x, trc R x x
| TrcFront : forall x y z,
  R x y
  -> trc R y z
  -> trc R x z.

(* Transitive-reflexive closure is so common that it deserves a shorthand notation! *)
Notation "R ^*" := (trc R) (at level 0).

(* Now let's use it to execute the factorial program. *)
Example factorial_3 : fact_step^* (WithAccumulator 3 1) (AnswerIs 6).
Proof.
Admitted.

(* It will be useful to give state machines more first-class status, as
 * *transition systems*, formalized by this record type.  It has one type
 * parameter, [state], which records the type of states. *)
Record trsys state := {
  Initial : state -> Prop;
  Step : state -> state -> Prop
}.

(* The example of our factorial program: *)
Definition factorial_sys (original_input : nat) : trsys fact_state := {|
  Initial := fact_init original_input;
  Step := fact_step
|}.

(* A useful general notion for transition systems: reachable states *)
Inductive reachable {state} (sys : trsys state) (st : state) : Prop :=
| Reachable : forall st0,
  sys.(Initial) st0
  -> sys.(Step)^* st0 st
  -> reachable sys st.

(* To prove that our state machine is correct, we rely on the crucial technique
 * of *invariants*.  What is an invariant?  Here's a general definition, in
 * terms of an arbitrary transition system. *)
Definition invariantFor {state} (sys : trsys state) (invariant : state -> Prop) :=
  forall s, sys.(Initial) s
            -> forall s', sys.(Step)^* s s'
                          -> invariant s'.
(* That is, when we begin in an initial state and take any number of steps, the
 * place we wind up always satisfies the invariant. *)

(* Here's a simple lemma to help us apply an invariant usefully,
 * really just restating the definition. *)

(** * Running transition systems in parallel *)

 * system the type of shared state remains the same, we take the Cartesian
 * product of the sets of private state. *)
