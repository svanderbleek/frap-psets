(* Subset types and their relatives help us integrate verification with
 * programming.  Though they reorganize the certified programmer's workflow,
 * they tend not to have deep effects on proofs.  We write largely the same
 * proofs as we would for classical verification, with some of the structure
 * moved into the programs themselves.  It turns out that, when we use dependent
 * types to their full potential, we warp the development and proving process
 * even more than that, picking up "free theorems" to the extent that often a
 * certified program is hardly more complex than its uncertified counterpart in
 * Haskell or ML.
 *
 * In particular, we have only scratched the tip of the iceberg that is Coq's
 * inductive definition mechanism. *)


(** * Length-Indexed Lists *)

(* Many introductions to dependent types start out by showing how to use them to
 * eliminate array bounds checks.  When the type of an array tells you how many
 * elements it has, your compiler can detect out-of-bounds dereferences
 * statically.  Since we are working in a pure functional language, the next
 * best thing is length-indexed lists, which the following code defines. *)

Section ilist.
  Variable A : Set.

  (* Note how now we are sure to write out the type of each constructor in full,
   * instead of using the shorthand notation we favored previously.  The reason
   * is that now the index to the inductive type [ilist] depends on details of a
   * constructor's arguments.  We are also using [Set], the type containing the
   * normal types of programming. *)
  Inductive ilist : nat -> Set :=
  | Nil : ilist O
  | Cons : forall n, A -> ilist n -> ilist (S n).

  (* We see that, within its section, [ilist] is given type [nat -> Set].
   * Previously, every inductive type we have seen has either had plain [Set] as
   * its type or has been a predicate with some type ending in [Prop].  The full
   * generality of inductive definitions lets us integrate the expressivity of
   * predicates directly into our normal programming.
   *
   * The [nat] argument to [ilist] tells us the length of the list.  The types
   * of [ilist]'s constructors tell us that a [Nil] list has length [O] and tha
   *  a [Cons] list has length one greater than the length of its tail.  We may
   * apply [ilist] to any natural number, even natural numbers that are only
   * known at runtime.  It is this breaking of the _phase distinction_ that
   * characterizes [ilist] as _dependently typed_.
   *
   * In expositions of list types, we usually see the length function defined
   * first, but here that would not be a very productive function to code.
   * Instead, let us implement list concatenation. *)

  Fixpoint app n1 (ls1 : ilist n1) n2 (ls2 : ilist n2) : ilist (n1 + n2) :=
    match ls1 with
      | Nil => ls2
      | Cons _ x ls1' => Cons x (app ls1' ls2)
    end.

  (* Past Coq versions signalled an error for this definition.  The code is
   * still invalid within Coq's core language, but current Coq versions
   * automatically add annotations to the original program, producing a valid
   * core program.  These are the annotations on [match] discriminees that we
   * began to study with subset types.  We can rewrite [app] to give the
   * annotations explicitly. *)

  Fixpoint app' n1 (ls1 : ilist n1) n2 (ls2 : ilist n2) : ilist (n1 + n2) :=
    match ls1 in (ilist n1) return (ilist (n1 + n2)) with
      | Nil => ls2
      | Cons _ x ls1' => Cons x (app' ls1' ls2)
    end.

  (* Using [return] alone allowed us to express a dependency of the [match]
   * result type on the _value_ of the discriminee.  What [in] adds to our
   * arsenal is a way of expressing a dependency on the _type_ of the
   * discriminee.  Specifically, the [n1] in the [in] clause above is a
   * _binding occurrence_ whose scope is the [return] clause.
   *
   * We may use [in] clauses only to bind names for the arguments of an
   * inductive type family.  That is, each [in] clause must be an inductive type
   * family name applied to a sequence of underscores and variable names of the
   * proper length.  The positions for _parameters_ to the type family must all
   * be underscores.  Parameters are those arguments declared with section
   * variables or with entries to the left of the first colon in an inductive
   * definition.  They cannot vary depending on which constructor was used to
   * build the discriminee, so Coq prohibits pointless matches on them.  It is
   * those arguments defined in the type to the right of the colon that we may
   * name with [in] clauses.
   *
   * Here's a useful function with a surprisingly subtle type, where the return
   * type depends on the _value_ of the argument. *)

  Fixpoint inject (ls : list A) : ilist (length ls) :=
    match ls with
      | nil => Nil
      | h :: t => Cons h (inject t)
    end.

  (* We can define an inverse conversion and prove that it really is an
   * inverse. *)

  Fixpoint unject n (ls : ilist n) : list A :=
    match ls with
      | Nil => nil
      | Cons _ h t => h :: unject t
    end.

  Theorem inject_inverse : forall ls, unject (inject ls) = ls.
  Proof.
    induct ls; simplify; equality.
  Qed.

  (* Now let us attempt a function that is surprisingly tricky to write.  In ML,
   * the list head function raises an exception when passed an empty list.  With
   * length-indexed lists, we can rule out such invalid calls statically, and
   * here is a first attempt at doing so.  We write [_] for a term that we wish
   * Coq would fill in for us, but we'll have no such luck. *)

  Fail Definition hd n (ls : ilist (S n)) : A :=
    match ls with
    | Nil => _
    | Cons _ h _ => h
    end.

  (* It is not clear what to write for the [Nil] case, so we are stuck before we
   * even turn our function over to the type checker.  We could try omitting the
   * [Nil] case. *)

  Fail Fail Definition hd n (ls : ilist (S n)) : A :=
    match ls with
    | Cons _ h _ => h
    end.

  (* Unlike in ML, we cannot use inexhaustive pattern matching, because there is
   * no conception of a <<Match>> exception to be thrown.  In fact, recent
   * versions of Coq _do_ allow this, by implicit translation to a [match] that
   * considers all constructors; the error message above was generated by an
   * older Coq version.  It is educational to discover for ourselves the
   * encoding that the most recent Coq versions use.  We might try using an [in]
   * clause somehow. *)

  Fail Fail Definition hd n (ls : ilist (S n)) : A :=
    match ls in (ilist (S n)) with
    | Cons _ h _ => h
    end.

  (* Due to some relatively new heuristics, Coq does accept this code, but in
   * general it is not legal to write arbitrary patterns for the arguments of
   * inductive types in [in] clauses.  Only variables are permitted there, in
   * Coq's core language.  A completely general mechanism could only be
   * supported with a solution to the problem of higher-order unification, which
   * is undecidable.
   *
   * Our final, working attempt at [hd] uses an auxiliary function and a
   * surprising [return] annotation. *)

  Definition hd' n (ls : ilist n) :=
    match ls in (ilist n) return (match n with O => unit | S _ => A end) with
      | Nil => tt
      | Cons _ h _ => h
    end.

  Check hd'.

  Definition hd n (ls : ilist (S n)) : A := hd' ls.
End ilist.

(* We annotate our main [match] with a type that is itself a [match].  We write
 * that the function [hd'] returns [unit] when the list is empty and returns the
 * carried type [A] in all other cases.  In the definition of [hd], we just call
 * [hd'].  Because the index of [ls] is known to be nonzero, the type checker
 * reduces the [match] in the type of [hd'] to [A]. *)


(** * The One Rule of Dependent Pattern Matching in Coq *)

(* The rest of this chapter will demonstrate a few other elegant applications of
 * dependent types in Coq.  Readers encountering such ideas for the first time
 * often feel overwhelmed, concluding that there is some magic at work whereby
 * Coq sometimes solves the halting problem for the programmer and sometimes
 * does not, applying automated program understanding in a way far beyond what
 * is found in conventional languages.  The point of this section is to cut off
 * that sort of thinking right now!  Dependent type-checking in Coq follows just
 * a few algorithmic rules, with just one for _dependent pattern matching_ of
 * the kind we met in the previous section.
 *
 * A dependent pattern match is a [match] expression where the type of the
 * overall [match] is a function of the value and/or the type of the
 * _discriminee_, the value being matched on.  In other words, the [match] type
 * _depends_ on the discriminee.
 *
 * When exactly will Coq accept a dependent pattern match as well-typed?  Some
 * other dependently typed languages employ fancy decision procedures to
 * determine when programs satisfy their very expressive types.  The situation
 * in Coq is just the opposite.  Only very straightforward symbolic rules are
 * applied.  Such a design choice has its drawbacks, as it forces programmers to
 * do more work to convince the type checker of program validity.  However, the
 * great advantage of a simple type checking algorithm is that its action on
 * _invalid_ programs is easier to understand!
 *
 * We come now to the one rule of dependent pattern matching in Coq.  A general
 * dependent pattern match assumes this form (with unnecessary parentheses
 * included to make the syntax easier to parse):
 [[
   match E as y in (T x1 ... xn) return U with
     | C z1 ... zm => B
     | ...
   end
 ]]
 * The discriminee is a term [E], a value in some inductive type family [T],
 * which takes [n] arguments.  An [as] clause binds the name [y] to refer to the
 * discriminee [E].  An [in] clause binds an explicit name [xi] for the [i]th
 * argument passed to [T] in the type of [E].
 *
 * We bind these new variables [y] and [xi] so that they may be referred to in
 * [U], a type given in the [return] clause.  The overall type of the [match]
 * will be [U], with [E] substituted for [y], and with each [xi] substituted by
 * the actual argument appearing in that position within [E]'s type.
 *
 * In general, each case of a [match] may have a pattern built up in several
 * layers from the constructors of various inductive type families.  To keep
 * this exposition simple, we will focus on patterns that are just single
 * applications of inductive type constructors to lists of variables.  Coq
 * actually compiles the more general kind of pattern matching into this more
 * restricted kind automatically, so understanding the typing of [match]
 * requires understanding the typing of [match]es lowered to match one
 * constructor at a time.
 *
 * The last piece of the typing rule tells how to type-check a [match] case.  A
 * generic constructor application [C z1 ... zm] has some type [T x1' ... xn'],
 * an application of the type family used in [E]'s type, probably with
 * occurrences of the [zi] variables.  From here, a simple recipe determines
 * what type we will require for the case body [B].  The type of [B] should be
 * [U] with the following two substitutions applied: we replace [y] (the [as]
 * clause variable) with [C z1 ... zm], and we replace each [xi] (the [in]
 * clause variables) with [xi'].  In other words, we specialize the result type
 * based on what we learn based on which pattern has matched the discriminee.
 *
 * This is an exhaustive description of the ways to specify how to take
 * advantage of which pattern has matched!  No other mechanisms come into play.
 * For instance, there is no way to specify that the types of certain free
 * variables should be refined based on which pattern has matched.
 *
 * A few details have been omitted above.  Inductive type families may have both
 * _parameters_ and regular arguments.  Within an [in] clause, a parameter
 * position must have the wildcard [_] written, instead of a variable.  (In
 * general, Coq uses wildcard [_]'s either to indicate pattern variables that
 * will not be mentioned again or to indicate positions where we would like type
 * inference to infer the appropriate terms.)  Furthermore, recent Coq versions
 * are adding more and more heuristics to infer dependent [match] annotations in
 * certain conditions.  The general annotation inference problem is undecidable,
 * so there will always be serious limitations on how much work these heuristics
 * can do.  When in doubt about why a particular dependent [match] is failing to
 * type-check, add an explicit [return] annotation!  At that point, the
 * mechanical rule sketched in this section will provide a complete account of
 * "what the type checker is thinking."  Be sure to avoid the common pitfall of
 * writing a [return] annotation that does not mention any variables bound by
 * [in] or [as]; such a [match] will never refine typing requirements based on
 * which pattern has matched.  (One simple exception to this rule is that, when
 * the discriminee is a variable, that same variable may be treated as if it
 * were repeated as an [as] clause.) *)


(** * A Tagless Interpreter *)

(* A favorite example for motivating the power of functional programming is
 * implementation of a simple expression language interpreter.  In ML and
 * Haskell, such interpreters are often implemented using an algebraic datatype
 * of values, where at many points it is checked that a value was built with the
 * right constructor of the value type.  With dependent types, we can implement a
 * _tagless_ interpreter that both removes this source of runtime inefficiency
 * and gives us more confidence that our implementation is correct. *)

Inductive type : Set :=
| Nat : type
| Bool : type
| Prod : type -> type -> type.

Inductive exp : type -> Set :=
| NConst : nat -> exp Nat
| Plus : exp Nat -> exp Nat -> exp Nat
| Eq : exp Nat -> exp Nat -> exp Bool

| BConst : bool -> exp Bool
| And : exp Bool -> exp Bool -> exp Bool
| If : forall t, exp Bool -> exp t -> exp t -> exp t

| Pair : forall t1 t2, exp t1 -> exp t2 -> exp (Prod t1 t2)
| Fst : forall t1 t2, exp (Prod t1 t2) -> exp t1
| Snd : forall t1 t2, exp (Prod t1 t2) -> exp t2.

(* We have a standard algebraic datatype [type], defining a type language of
 * naturals, Booleans, and product (pair) types.  Then we have the indexed
 * inductive type [exp], where the argument to [exp] tells us the encoded type
 * of an expression.  In effect, we are defining the typing rules for
 * expressions simultaneously with the syntax.
 *
 * We can give types and expressions semantics in a new style, based critically
8 on the chance for _type-level computation_. *)

Fixpoint typeDenote (t : type) : Set :=
  match t with
    | Nat => nat
    | Bool => bool
    | Prod t1 t2 => typeDenote t1 * typeDenote t2
  end%type.

(* The [typeDenote] function compiles types of our object language into "native"
 * Coq types.  It is deceptively easy to implement.  The only new thing we see
 * is the [%type] annotation, which tells Coq to parse the [match] expression
 * using the notations associated with types.  Without this annotation, the [*]
 * would be interpreted as multiplication on naturals, rather than as the
 * product type constructor.  The token [%type] is one example of an identifier
 * bound to a _notation scope delimiter_.
 *
 * We can define a function [expDenote] that is typed in terms of
 * [typeDenote]. *)

Fixpoint expDenote t (e : exp t) : typeDenote t :=
  match e with
    | NConst n => n
    | Plus e1 e2 => expDenote e1 + expDenote e2
    | Eq e1 e2 => if eq_nat_dec (expDenote e1) (expDenote e2) then true else false

    | BConst b => b
    | And e1 e2 => expDenote e1 && expDenote e2
    | If _ e' e1 e2 => if expDenote e' then expDenote e1 else expDenote e2

    | Pair _ _ e1 e2 => (expDenote e1, expDenote e2)
    | Fst _ _ e' => fst (expDenote e')
    | Snd _ _ e' => snd (expDenote e')
  end.

(* Despite the fancy type, the function definition is routine.  In fact, it is
 * less complicated than what we would write in ML or Haskell 98, since we do
 * not need to worry about pushing final values in and out of an algebraic
 * datatype.  The only unusual thing is the use of an expression of the form
 * [if E then true else false] in the [Eq] case.  Remember that [eq_nat_dec] has
 * a rich dependent type, rather than a simple Boolean type.  Coq's native [if]
 * is overloaded to work on a test of any two-constructor type, so we can use
 * [if] to build a simple Boolean from the [sumbool] that [eq_nat_dec] returns.
 *
 * We can implement our old favorite, a constant-folding function, and prove it
 * correct.  It will be useful to write a function [pairOut] that checks if an
 * [exp] of [Prod] type is a pair, returning its two components if so.
 * Unsurprisingly, a first attempt leads to a type error. *)

Fail Definition pairOut t1 t2 (e : exp (Prod t1 t2)) : option (exp t1 * exp t2) :=
  match e in (exp (Prod t1 t2)) return option (exp t1 * exp t2) with
    | Pair _ _ e1 e2 => Some (e1, e2)
    | _ => None
  end.

(* We run again into the problem of not being able to specify non-variable
 * arguments in [in] clauses (and this time Coq's avant-garde heuristics don't
 * save us).  The problem would just be hopeless without a use of an [in]
 * clause, though, since the result type of the [match] depends on an argument
 * to [exp].  Our solution will be to use a more general type, as we did for
 * [hd].  First, we define a type-valued function to use in assigning a type to
 * [pairOut]. *)

Definition pairOutType (t : type) := option (match t with
                                               | Prod t1 t2 => exp t1 * exp t2
                                               | _ => unit
                                             end).

(* When passed a type that is a product, [pairOutType] returns our final desired
 * type.  On any other input type, [pairOutType] returns the harmless
 * [option unit], since we do not care about extracting components of non-pairs.
 * Now [pairOut] is easy to write. *)

Definition pairOut t (e : exp t) :=
  match e in (exp t) return (pairOutType t) with
    | Pair _ _ e1 e2 => Some (e1, e2)
    | _ => None
  end.

(* With [pairOut] available, we can write [cfold] in a straightforward way.
 * There are really no surprises beyond that Coq verifies that this code has
 * such an expressive type, given the small annotation burden.  In some places,
 * we see that Coq's [match] annotation inference is too smart for its own
 * good, and we have to turn that inference off with explicit [return]
 * clauses. *)

Fixpoint cfold t (e : exp t) : exp t :=
  match e with
    | NConst n => NConst n
    | Plus e1 e2 =>

(** * Dependently Typed Red-Black Trees *)

(* Red-black trees are a favorite purely functional data structure with an
 * interesting invariant.  We can use dependent types to guarantee that
 * operations on red-black trees preserve the invariant.  For simplicity, we
 * specialize our red-black trees to represent sets of [nat]s. *)

Inductive color : Set := Red | Black.

Inductive rbtree : color -> nat -> Set :=
| Leaf : rbtree Black 0
| RedNode : forall n, rbtree Black n -> nat -> rbtree Black n -> rbtree Red n
| BlackNode : forall c1 c2 n, rbtree c1 n -> nat -> rbtree c2 n -> rbtree Black (S n).

(* A value of type [rbtree c d] is a red-black tree whose root has color [c] and
 * that has black depth [d].  The latter property means that there are exactly
 * [d] black-colored nodes on any path from the root to a leaf. *)

(* At first, it can be unclear that this choice of type indices tracks any
 * useful property.  To convince ourselves, we will prove that every red-black
 * tree is balanced.  We will phrase our theorem in terms of a depth-calculating
 * function that ignores the extra information in the types.  It will be useful
 * to parameterize this function over a combining operation, so that we can
 * reuse the same code to calculate the minimum or maximum height among all
 * paths from root to leaf. *)

Section depth.

    end.
End depth.

(* Our proof of balanced-ness decomposes naturally into a lower bound and an
 * upper bound.  We prove the lower bound first.  Unsurprisingly, a tree's black
 * depth provides such a bound on the minimum path length. *)

(* There is an analogous upper-bound theorem based on black depth.

Abort.

(* In particular, we prove a lemma that provides a stronger upper bound for

  (* There is one subtle point in the [split'] code that is worth mentioning.

   * [match] annotations, the type-checker does not use the equality between [n]

   * bodies in dependently typed Coq code.  We can at least use a [let]

 * with types and programs in other examples.  That style is compatible with the
 * [refine]-based approach that we have used here, and it might be an
 * interesting exercise to redo the code from this subsection in that
 * alternative style or some further encoding of the reader's choice.  The main
